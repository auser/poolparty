== DESCRIPTION:

PoolParty makes cloud provisioning and management easy. PoolParty provides a unified interface for defining and managing cloud infrasturcure on different cloud providers (just Ec2 for now).

Code your cloud! 

== SYNOPSIS:

PoolParty is written with the intention of being as application-agnostic as possible. It installs only the basic 
required software to glue the cloud together on the instances as listed below.

== Quickstart

For instance, to start a basic cloud, let's write one:

  pool "demo" do
    cloud "app" do
      instances 2..10
      using :ec2
      autoscale do      
        trigger :lower_threshold => 0.3, :upper_threshold => 1.0, :measure => :cpu
      end
      security_group do
        authorize :from_port => 22, :to_port => 22
      end
      load_balancer do
        listener :external_port => 8080, :internal_port => 8080, :protocol => 'tcp'
      end
    end
  end
  
Simply by issuing the command:
  
  cloud start
  
This will create an ec2 auto scaling group that will launch the minimum_instances (2 in this case,) inside a security group. The default naming of most objects, such as security_groups, auto scaling groups, launch_configurations, load_balancers and keypairs follow the poolname-cloudname convention.
There are a number of commands PoolParty offers to interact with your cloud. They include:

* <tt>cloud start</tt>
* <tt>cloud terminate</tt>
* <tt>cloud reboot</tt>
* <tt>cloud configure</tt>
* <tt>cloud compile</tt>
* <tt>cloud console</tt>
* <tt>cloud expand</tt>
* <tt>cloud contract</tt>
* <tt>cloud list</tt>
* <tt>cloud show</tt>
* <tt>cloud ssh</tt>
* <tt>cloud run</tt>

Clouds are distinguished by security groups. If a security group is not specified in your cloud block, one will be created based on the naming convention poolname-cloudname.

== Extending

To add a cloud_provider, there are four methods that need to be implemented. Simply sublcass the CloudProviders module and require it in your clouds.rb (or commit it back to PoolParty). Those four methods are:

* <tt>run_instance</tt>
* <tt>terminate_instance</tt>
* <tt>describe_instances</tt>
* <tt>describe_instance</tt>
